        BJJ is a martial art and combat sport that focuses on grappling and ground fighting. It promotes the concept
        that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger assailant by using leverage
        and proper technique. BJJ is a great way to stay in shape, build confidence, and learn self-defense.
