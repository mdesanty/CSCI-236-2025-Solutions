    <p>
      Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court,
      compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball through the defender's hoop while preventing the opposing team from
      shooting through their own hoop.It is a fast-paced and exciting sport that requires skill, teamwork, and athleticism. I could dunk
      when I was younger.
